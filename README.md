# Python Tasks

This repository contains three Python tasks, each solving a different problem.

## Task 1: Calculate Area with Conditions

This task includes a function `calculate_area` that calculates the area of a rectangle. If the length and width are equal, it returns "This is a square!" instead of the area.

## Task 2: Generate Fibonacci Series

This task includes a function `Fibonacci_sequence` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms, n. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

## Task 3: MySQL Database Operations with Python

This task involves connecting to a MySQL database and performing various operations such as creating a database and table, inserting a new record, updating a record, deleting a record, and fetching all records.

in this task while execution we have to keep few things in our mind 
* we need mysql package
* after creating database and table we can't create database and table with the same name so after creating database and table comment it.
